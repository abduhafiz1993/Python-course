# Functional Programming


 Python also supports the Functional Programming Paradigm, in which functions are treated as values just like any other variable.

 ### Decorators

One thing made possible by functional programming is the idea of a decorator, which is a higher-order function that can modify another function. For example, letâ€™s write a decorator that announces when a function is about to begin, and when it ends. We can then apply this decorator using an @ symbol.
