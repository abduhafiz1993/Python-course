# Object-Oriented Programming

There are different paradigms of programming. As you learn other languages, you will start recognizing patterns like these.
Up until this point, you have worked procedurally step-by-step.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a compelling solution to programming-related problems.


### Classes
Classes are a way by which, in object-oriented programming, we can create our own type of data and give them names.
A class is like a mold for a type of data – where we can invent our own data type and give them a name.
Any time you create a class and you utilize that blueprint to create something, you create what is called an “object” or an “instance”. In the case of our code is an object.


### raise
Object-oriented program encourages you to encapusulate all the functionality of a class within the class definition. What if something goes wrong? What if someone tries to type in something random? What if someone tries to create a student without a name? 

### __str__

def __str__(self) provides a means by which a student is returned when called. Therefore, you can now, as the programmer, print an object, its attributes, or almost anything you desire related to that object.
__str__ is a built-in method that comes with Python classes. 

#### It just so happens that we can create our own methods for a class as well!
