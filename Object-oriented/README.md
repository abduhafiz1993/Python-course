There are different paradigms of programming. As you learn other languages, you will start recognizing patterns like these.
Up until this point, you have worked procedurally step-by-step.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a compelling solution to programming-related problems.

Classes are a way by which, in object-oriented programming, we can create our own type of data and give them names.

Any time you create a class and you utilize that blueprint to create something, you create what is called an “object” or an “instance”. In the case of our code is an object.
